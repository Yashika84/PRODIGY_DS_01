This repository contains my submission for Task 01 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech.

The goal of this task is to create visualizations such as bar charts or histograms to represent the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable â€” e.g., population by gender or year.In this task, I explored the dataset through Exploratory Data Analysis EDA and created visualizations, such as bar charts and histograms, to understand how different values are distributed.

# DataSet
The data used is sourced from the **World Bank Open Data**:
>> [World Bank Population Dataset (SP.POP.TOTL)] :https://github.com/Yashika84/PRODIGY_DS_01/blob/main/worldpopulationdata.csv
This dataset contains total population values for countries worldwide between 2001 and 2022.


# Tools & Libraries 
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**

# Workflow Summary
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Loaded and explored the dataset to understand structure .
- Handled missing values, if any, and cleaned the data accordingly.

 2. Data Visualization
- Created bar charts to visualize population data.
- Applied appropriate labels, color schemes, and axes formatting.

  # Learning Outcomes

- Gained experience in basic EDA on real-world time-series data.
- Practiced Python-based ata visualization using Matplotlib & Seaborn.
- Practice Pandas library.

# Conclusion
Through this task, I gained a deeper understanding of how data visualization can uncover hidden patterns within large datasets. Performing EDA on the population dataset helped me explore demographic trends and enhanced my ability to communicate findings through visual representation. This exercise reinforced the value of clean data and clear visuals in the data science workflow.

Thank you for reviewing my submission
