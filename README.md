This repository contains my submission for Task 01 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech.

The goal of this task is to create visualizations such as bar charts or histograms to represent the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable â€” e.g., population by gender or year.In this task, I explored the dataset through Exploratory Data Analysis EDA and created visualizations, such as bar charts and histograms, to understand how different values are distributed.

# DataSet
The data used is sourced from the **World Bank Open Data**:
> [World Bank Population Dataset (SP.POP.TOTL)] :
